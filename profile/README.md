# Deafwave
This organization was established to help aspiring developers learn via creating tools for games.

Developing tools for games offers a unique and engaging way to accelerate your programming skills. Unlike more traditional projects, such as building a calculator, game Quality of Life/Bot tools provide a low barrier of entry with immediate, tangible feedback and a rewarding sense of accomplishment. This rapid dopamine response keeps you motivated and encourages faster learning, making it an ideal path for both entry-level and experienced developers looking to advance their knowledge.
